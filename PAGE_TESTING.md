# Web Page Design

We will have the following pages:
- Splash Page
- Game
- User/Account Page
- Login/Register
- Store
- Tips

## Splash Page

## Game
This is the game page where users will interact with their Taskagotchi, add new tasks, complete existing tasks, and nourish their Taskagotchi avatar. 

It will show streams of days of consistent task-ing, as well as Taskagotchi stats and inventory options. 

We could potentially add the username as a parameter in the URL later on if there was some sort of social feature and we wanted users to be able to share links with their friends that would go directly to their page.

### Data Needed:
- Tasks by user
- Last completed Task date for streak
- Time until complete
- Taskagotchi by user
- Taskagotchi health
- User inventory
- Taskagotchi energy
