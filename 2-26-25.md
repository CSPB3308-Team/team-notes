Milestone 3: Weekly status
- Snapshot of tool, add more commentary
    - Pat made the repo
- John will do the stuff

Database Docker
- we may not need to log in
- quick demo of how it works
    - make up: spins up container
    - make start: logs stuff
    - make migrate: builds a "migrations", contians
- Contains most of the database stuff
    - Postgres / PGadmin
    - everything *should* sync, even though it's running locally
    - conflicts?
        - Changes to structure are transferred
        - changes to actual are local only
    - spin up test container, run it, then terminate it
        - use "seed" file to prepare tests

Database Design
- have another meeting sometime soon to go over design / relations
- another meeting for database designs
    - 3:30 p.m. M.T. on Friday 2/28

"Sideburn" Chart
- Create issues for ideas
    - group can vote on will do / want to do / won't do
    - If we will do it, create a ticket that people can claim and get working on it 
    - for critical, MUST do things, just make the ticket and get 'er done

UI Design
- good start, something to work off of
- check the excalidraw link, leave some notes / critiques
- maybe 3 unique pages
    - Splash page: what users see when not logged in
    - Task page: React-based primary page
        - User avatar on game canvas (left) and task list (right)
            - task list delineated by long term tasks and short-term / daily tasks       
    - Motivation tips / blog page(?): Could be a fun extra thing 
        - helps support the idea that we're trying to help people improve themselves
    
Game Design Discussion
- Rewards
    - completing tasks grants coins (or some other currency) that the user can spend on stuff
        - new decorations, or customization for their avatar 
        - could also be spent to help avatar with needs?
    - Avatar energy also refills a bit when completing tasks
        - more energy for long-term tasks?
    
- Task Categories
    - Long-term
        - Set specific time / date by which task should be completed
        - User shouldn't be able to mark it as complete too soon after creation
            - Probably shouldn't be able to create tasks with too soon a deadline either
        - User can claim rewards up to (One day? Two days?) after deadline (?)
            - maybe spend small amount of some currency to claim points late
    - Short-term / Daily
        - Simple "check-off" style tasks
        - Smaller rewards
        - For daily, user can claim rewards until 12 p.m. the following day 
            - OR no leeway! Make them come back or lose the points!
    - Custom tasks, or predetermined lists?
        - Custom is preferred - there are lots and lots of potential tasks
        - Could add some simple / common tasks to make the process easier
- Task Difficulty
    - Give more rewards based on a tasks difficulty?
    - Preset / recommended, or user choice?
        - may be better to let user could choose
            - "difficulty" is different for everyone
            - could select a smily face, frowny face, or neutral face when making the task
- STREAKS
    - more important than *anything* else
    - extra rewards for maintaining a high streak
- Task Linking
    - link your "home"/avatar to another person(s)
        - see them hanging out with your avatar
    - completing tasks benefits both people
    - see each other's lists?
    
Code Format
- Important for when we all start writing code
    - commits could get messy / annoying without a consistent style
- Prettier 
    - (the code formatter, not the statement)
    - auto-formats everyones code to follow a consistent style
    - not for Python?
- There are some things that can auto-format when you push?
    - also workflows that will 
    - VS Code extension?
    - just need a consensus
