## Vision Statement
Changing a routine is hard, especially if you’re stuck in a rut due to burnout, depression, or just plain apathy. The inertia of old routines can take over, making new tasks feel impossible as you struggle to find motivation and create new momentum. When setting new personal goals, many people will just use a calendar, sticky notes, their default reminder app, or some other overused, ineffective method. While these solutions may seem "straightforward", they're also boring, and worse: they don't actually improve motivation. This causes people to give up quickly, or be hard on themselves when they don’t fulfill their own goals. 

Our solution: gamifying productivity and habit changes through constant and immediate feedback, making a difficult change both fun and engaging. `Taskagotchi` will help people break out of this loop by introducing an alternative method for conceptualizing self-defined paths to success. Users can keep track of deadlines for work projects, school assignments, appointments, meetings, and more. Users can also set reminders for doing chores, taking medication, or any other type of activity that they need a little extra motivation to remember. By combining habit tracking with daily streaks, motivational achievements, and other fun and engaging mechanics, `Taskagotchi` will provide a new way for users of all ages to make progress in nearly any aspect of their daily lives.

## Motivation
We want to make productivity fun so habits stick. As post-bacc students, we know firsthand the value of deciding to change direction and embark on a new journey in life. At the same time, it’s human nature to take the path of least resistance, especially when balancing demands such as school, work, family, and life. Through this project, we aim to create something that will help ourselves and others follow through with their goals by making productivity fun, and by creating a positive and affirmative system of accountability.

## Risks to Project Completion

#### No prior experience working as a team: 
This team has not worked together before, so we will need to take measures to ensure clear and open communication and potentially adjust our workflows as we get to know each other. 

#### New programming languages, tools, and working environments:
We all have different levels of experience with the different languages and technologies that we will be using to develop this project. Even though our skills are mostly complementary, we will each need to take the time to develop new skills as the project progresses. Furthermore, creating the groundwork for our project early in the semester, and then developing the project as we learn about new technologies each week will itself carry various risks and benefits. Since we do not know what we can realistically achieve with the tools that will be covered in the course, we may overshoot or undershoot with our expectations during the planning phase and need to adjust the project's scope during later phases. On the other hand, learning the tools while we have a project in development will provide valuable context, ideally allowing us to have a more productive and grounded learning experience, and ultimately a more mature end product

#### Limited artistic talent:
Given the concept for our project, we would ideally have a strong visual identity. It would be nice to have different characters and/or environments that users can interact with in order to form positive mental associations with their habits. However, devoting too much time to visual art could detract from our efforts in making a functional product, and commissioning art assets is outside the scope of the project. However, we plan to strike a balance as noted in the Mitigation Strategy section. 

#### Scope creep:
While we plan to approach the project with flexibility so that we can change or add features if the need arises during development, it is possible to get off track with time and focus by getting distracted with too many new ideas or changes in the middle of development.  


## Mitigation Strategy
- Keep communication frequent, open and honest in stand ups. Ask for help when needed from other team mates. We are using apps selected for chat (Discord) and scheduling/availability (www.when2meet.com) and will adapt as needed throughout the semester 
- Ensure that we maintain branch protection in GitHub to prevent pushing bad code to the main branch. Use development branches for building out new features.
- Use GitHub’s built-in project tracking (explained further below) to clearly and conveniently manage what needs to be done and who will take charge of each task. 
- Create and maintain a dependable and thorough testing suite used to check new code additions don’t break existing and working features. 
- Perform constructive, thorough, and efficient code reviews.
- Focus on getting an MVP (minimum viable product) first are foremost, and then expanding on the desired features as time allows.
- Use simple drawings and models to demonstrate the product's effectiveness; higher quality assets can be created after the product is functional.
- Scope creep: We will plan to take the work one step at a time so that we can manage changes and additions as a group and keep the potential need for changes at a minimum for each step. This will help us adapt to the needs of the project as it unfolds without interfering with the workflow drastically. This is important to avoid wasted time and effort.  If changes become a problem during development, we will re-evaluate the management process for approving and implementing changes.
- Lack of resources: We will make it a priority to identify resources that are essential to the project and acquire them as soon as possible. This way we will avoid potentially having to backtrack or make significant changes to the plan.

## Development Method & Project Tracking

You can find our Project Tracking here: https://github.com/orgs/CSPB3308-Team/projects/1

Our development method follows an agile-inspired workflow which will utilize the built-in Github tools to keep all of our Development tracking and code in one location. Leveraging the GitHub Organization we created for our team, we will use these suites of built-in tools to ensure smooth collaboration, transparency, and efficiency that closely mirrors many large-scale real-world projects.

We use the Project Board (our Kanban Board) to organize and track our tasks, allowing us to track issues, assign responsibilities, and monitor progress in a visually structured way that is easy to follow. Tasks such as feature requests, bugs, etc. are categorized into columns indicating their status. The ‘Backlog’ column will be for features we aren’t quite ready for at the moment that may be blocked by an existing issue, or that are still in discussion. The ‘Ready’ column is for tasks that are ready to be assigned to a team member. ‘In Progress’ designates tasks that are currently being worked on. When a task is ready to be reviewed, it will be moved into ‘In Review’ where it will indicate that a pull request has been made that needs to be reviewed. Finally, the ‘Done’ column will showcase all the tasks that have been completed and merged into the project. Each issue in this process will be assigned to team members with priority and category labels (bug, documentation, enhancement, etc) for further tracking. 

As for Project Tracking, the Organization’s Github Roadmap tool will serve as our high-level project tracking tool which should provide an accurate timeline of milestones, features and deliverable due dates. This will help the team stay aligned on long-term objectives quickly while having finer, more detailed short-term tasks that facilitate these objects located just a click away on the Kanban board. 

GitHub's all-in-one project management ecosystem allows us to track, assign, and resolve tasks efficiently in a one-stop collaboration workspace.
